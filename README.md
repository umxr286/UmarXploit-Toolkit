## 🚀 My Mission

I’m not a cybersecurity expert — *yet*.  
But I’m committed to becoming one through relentless learning, ethical hacking, and building tools that make systems safer.

I believe in accepting where I am, so I can grow beyond it. Every exploit I study, every vulnerability I test, brings me closer to mastering this craft.
