## 🧪 Projects & Experience

### 🔍 ByteForensics (March–May 2025)
Dissertation Title: Developing a forensic tool that collects, analyses, and visualises artefacts of Windows PE files from a disk image

ByteForensics is a custom-built web application designed to perform forensic analysis on Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. It was developed as part of my final-year dissertation in cybersecurity.
- Built and hosted locally using XAMPP, integrating MySQL and Apache for backend support
- Successfully implemented client-side analysis and visualization of individual PE files uploaded via the main web interface
- Designed with cross-platform compatibility in mind, tested across multiple host devices
- Faced technical challenges when attempting to analyze PE files embedded within full disk images:
Required additional third-party software to mount and extract contents from disk images
Encountered limitations in automating extraction and parsing of PE artefacts from mounted images
- Despite these hurdles, the tool performed effectively for standalone PE file analysis and visualization

### 🛡️ Ethical Penetration Test (May 2025)
Conducted a full black-box penetration test using my **Parrot OS pentesting machine**.  
- Discovered and exploited **5 vulnerabilities**, capturing all associated flags  
- Used tools like `nmap`, service enumeration, and GitHub exploit scripts  
- Demonstrated real-world exploitation in a controlled lab environment

### 🕹️ NEC(National Exhibition Centre) Tech Showcase — Interactive Chatbot Game (April 2025)
Role: Tech Learner

Attended the NEC Cyber Security event and engaged with an interactive chatbot experience powered by a Raspberry Pi. The project featured a screen-based interface that guided users through a game-like journey using conversational prompts. This experience deepened my understanding of embedded systems, chatbot logic, and the role of secure communication in interactive design. Most importantly, upon reflection, it taught me the importance and value of a Raspberry Pi.

### Highlights:

Raspberry Pi-powered chatbot demo

Screen-based interaction without physical buttons or sensors

Exposure to real-world cybersecurity applications

### ☁️ Cover Shift Tracker — Cloud Application (Feb–May 2025)
Led a team of two in designing and deploying a cloud-based application called Cover Shift Tracker, aimed at streamlining shift management and coverage tracking.
- Developed and deployed locally within AWS Cloud, using a custom VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) architecture
- Configured the VPC with 2 public subnets (for internet-facing components) and 2 private subnets (for internal services and databases)
- All application resources — including EC2 instances, databases, and storage — were provisioned and isolated within the VPC for secure connectivity
- Focused on secure deployment, subnet routing, and access control to ensure proper segmentation and scalability
- Oversaw the full development lifecycle: planning, coding, testing, and deployment
- My leadership and technical direction directly contributed to the project’s success, earning a 2:1 grade in final assessment

### 🌍 NASA Space Apps Challenge (October 2024)
Participated in NASA’s global hackathon focused on climate change awareness.  
- Collaborated with a team to build gaming applications and a website  
- Researched NASA-provided datasets to support the narrative  
- Reinforced environmental awareness through interactive design
